This project demonstrates the capabilities of semantic blogging. With semantic technologies
one can add additional metadata in the blog posts. In particular, a blog post can add metadata about 
what resource it is talking about, what other webpages are referenced etc. This project is an
attempt to harvest these additional metada and expose them as RESTfull resources. One can then use 
Semblog Browser plugin extension to see the related blog posts in the original webpage itself.

---This is a Maven Project---
In your preferred IDE such as Eclipse:
- Import semblog as a Maven Project

semblog.tstore - harvests rdf data from semantic blogs and stores them to a RDF store using Jena RDF API.
		Additionally blog tags are indexed  using Apache Lucene to find similar blogs.
